ðŸŽ°ðŸ¤– Multi-Armed Bandit Simulation with Beta Distribution ðŸ¤–ðŸŽ°
Project Overview

This project simulates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem, a classic scenario in probability theory and decision-making. The objective is to maximize cumulative rewards by selecting the most optimal "slot machine" (bandit) over time. The simulation employs Beta distribution to model the probability of success for each bandit, facilitating a balance between exploration and exploitation.

Purpose

The primary goal is to demonstrate the application of Beta distribution in solving the MAB problem. By simulating multiple bandits with varying success probabilities, the project aims to identify the most rewarding bandit through iterative trials.
Key Features

    Simulation of Multiple Bandits: Modeling several slot machines, each with a distinct probability of yielding a reward.
    Beta Distribution Application: Utilizing Beta distribution to represent the uncertainty in each bandit's success probability.
    Iterative Selection Process: Implementing a strategy to select bandits based on their estimated success probabilities, updating beliefs after each trial.
    Performance Tracking: Recording the number of times each bandit is selected and the cumulative rewards obtained.

Data Sources

    Simulated Data: The project generates synthetic data representing the success probabilities of each bandit.

Installation and Setup
